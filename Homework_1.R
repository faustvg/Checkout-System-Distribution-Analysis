#The summary statistics gives an overview of the central tendency and spread of the data. 
#By looking at the given data we can see the data might be a right-skewed distribution with heavy tails. 
#Based of that we could consider the exponential distribution as well as the triangle distribution
#due to its right-skewed nature.Another distribution could be the normal distribution as it 
#may approximate right-skewed Datasets.

# Exponential distirbution 
# The overlaid exponential distribution curve signifies a strong with some variability within the dataset. 
# Overall, the visual  suggests a good representation of the data . 

# Triangle distribution 
# The triangle shape does not indicate a central tendency which would 
# be usually the case for the distribution. 

# Normal distribution 
# The plot shows a unique profile deviating from the classic bell shape. 
# The initial increase followed by a curve suggests a derivation from symmetry. This asymmetric pattern may indicate a skewness


# Which two distribution fits the best the data: 
# By looking at the data we see two distributions with the highest accuracy of the curve and the plot are exponential and 
# the normal distribution. Even the normal distribution does not show the complete shape bell form, 
# it still fits better to the data then the triangle distribution

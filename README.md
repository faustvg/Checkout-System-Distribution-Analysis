# Checkout System Distribution Analysis

This repository is part of a homework from a Software Tools Simulation class and contains R code for the analysis of an Checkout Systemd istribution 
dataset named "UnknownDistribution_corrected.csv". 

The analysis involves descriptive statistics, histogram plotting, and fitting three potential distributions (Exponential, Triangle, and Normal)
to the data. 

The goal is to try different distribution and analyze them in order to identify the best-fitting distribution for the given dataset.
